# 📷 Google Images Downloader

This project consists of two Python files (`pg_main.py` and `new.py`) for downloading images from Google based on user input. It uses the `selenium` library to scrape images and the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows users to search for images by entering keywords, specify the number of images to download, and choose a folder to save the images.
